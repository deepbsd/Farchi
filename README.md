# FARCHI    Fast Arch Linux Installer

This started as just a personal script, very very simple way to install 
Arch Linux after booting the archiso ISO image.  

You can download the script to your booted archiso image like this:

`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbsd/farchi/master/farchi.sh`

If you open the farchi script and start filling in the
variables carefully, you'll be ready to install Arch linux!
Good luck!
